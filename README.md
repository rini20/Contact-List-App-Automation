# Contact List App Automation

## Overview

This project automates the core functionalities of the Contact List App, including adding, editing, and deleting contacts. The automation is implemented using Python, Selenium, and the pytest framework. This project was created as part of my learning journey in Python and Selenium.

## Key Features

- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive automation of add, edit, and delete functionalities in the Contact List App.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Utilizes Selenium for interacting with the web elements of the application.
- **pytest Framework**: Employs pytest for organizing and running test cases, with fixtures for setup and teardown.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements the POM design pattern to enhance maintainability and readability of test scripts.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Includes parameterized fixtures to run tests with different sets of data.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Generates logs and test reports, stored in a dedicated `logs` and `reports` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- pip (Python package installer)
